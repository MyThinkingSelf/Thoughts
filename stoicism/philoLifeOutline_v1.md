> Target both heightness and emptyness. Be the architect of a baroque tower in a peaceful environnement. This way, you will benefit from both worlds, joy and calm. On the opposite, building a busy city would only let your soul being invaded by the two poisons of existence, tyrannic passions and wounded Ego. Both need the baroque tower to dissipate their energy and give you joy, both need the peaceful environnement to be mastered.

> Tyrannic passions and wounded Ego are like beasts who need to be tammed and used. If you only plan to sedate them, they will still have enough energy to act in disguise, insiduously, without grace, without strengh, shaming and troubling the master. Besides, only your beasts can keep in respect the biggest monster, absurdism, which comes to visit one night at a time, giving a dark word at a time. You can lie to yourself, saying that you also sedated the biggest monster or that the biggest monster does not exists. I respect this choice which is highly reasonnable. But before that, why not giving a try and see how well your beasts can fight him ?
