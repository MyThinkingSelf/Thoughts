> Target both heightness and emptyness. Be the architect of a baroque tower in a peaceful environnement. This way, you will benefit from both worlds, joy and calm. On the opposite, building a busy city would only let your soul being invaded by the two poisons of existence, tyrannic passions and wounded Ego. Both need the baroque tower to dissipate their energy and give you joy, both need the peaceful environnement to be mastered.
*************** 
> Do not build your tower with the ideal of the tower in your mind. Build it with the love of the artisan, focused on his task, with the dilligent attention. Don't ever target heavens,  target your next brick. Ideals would only poison you. Leading you to go back and forth in your tower and your peaceful environnement not to feel joy and calm, but tortured and enslaved by mania and melancholia.
*************** 
> Tyrannic passions and wounded Ego are like beasts who need to be tammed and used. If you only plan to sedate them, they will still have enough energy to act in disguise, insiduously, without grace, without strengh, shaming and troubling the master. Besides, only your beasts can keep in respect the biggest monster, absurdism, which comes to visit one night at a time, giving a dark word at a time. You can lie to yourself, saying that you also sedated the biggest monster or that the biggest monster does not exists. I respect this choice which is highly reasonnable. But before that, why not giving a try and see how well your beasts can fight him ?

> Truly I tell you, you have a soul inner your soul. They are like mother and child. The mother let some freedom to her progeniture. The mother and only the mother is the True Invicible Citadel. The child heritates much from her mother so that they are sometimes undistinguishable, she has her composure and their calm joy. But the child must depense its energy from time to time, and sometimes, she ask if she can go to play. With affection, the mother accepts. She let them run away, measure her strengh, conquer new worlds, get scared, sometimes get back in tears. But she never feel pain long, because the mother is there, and her protection is infinite, they both know it deeply and never lose confidence. When she asked firmy "stop crying now, there is nothing to tear about" or "calm down now, you have enough played", the child executes instantly, without ever questionning, by confidence for the mother and self-respect. The mother has reached the Highest Acceptation and the Higher Calm. The couple can't be destroyed. They conquer battles without never lose peace.
