Evening exercices :
- Review the day 5min
- Prepare virtue for the next day 5min
Review = good day, light loss of temper in sport, I could have avoid it. The rest is fine. Too much expectation related to facebook. Very very light, but more preparation before posting would have been better. Any jealousy has been avoided today. Good preparation to end my *passionate* focus on stoicism to avoid problems.
