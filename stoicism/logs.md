Evening exercices :
- Review the day 5min
- Prepare virtue for the next day 5min
Review = good day, light loss of temper in sport, I could have avoid it. The rest is fine. Too much expectation related to facebook. Very very light, but more preparation before posting would have been better. Any jealousy has been avoided today. Good preparation to end my *passionate* focus on stoicism to avoid problems.

## 27/10/2015
Morning :
- Breathing exercice 
- Full images chain 
- Prepare day 
Note : difficulties this morning as I slept not much (6h). I noticed before that with (even minor) reduction of sleep, I have harder time to empty my mind during exercices, and get vivid images in vizualisations. Nonetheless, I accepted it and done as much as I could. I feel in control right now (8.30 am). My goal today is to stay in control like yesterday from 8am to 4pm. I valued my time and stayed alert. But at 4pm I lost it.
Evening :
- none

Managed to keep a stoic mindset dealing with people, especially one person with a wrong character. "it seems right to him" works well. And it's not that a trick. There is good chances that it seems right to him.
The place where I went were people discuss philosophy is very therapeutic. This is not the first time I get out with a profound feeling of calm. The intellectual activity of listening to people the most I could while building my own thoughts made my mind in the same state my body is after intense sport.
