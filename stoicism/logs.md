Evening exercices :
- Review the day 5min
- Prepare virtue for the next day 5min
Review = good day, light loss of temper in sport, I could have avoid it. The rest is fine. Too much expectation related to facebook. Very very light, but more preparation before posting would have been better. Any jealousy has been avoided today. Good preparation to end my *passionate* focus on stoicism to avoid problems.

Morning :
- Breathing exercice 
- Full images chain 
- Prepare day 
Note : difficulties this morning as I slept not much (6h). I noticed before that with (even minor) reduction of sleep, I have harder time to empty my mind during exercices, and get vivid images in vizualisations. Nonetheless, I accepted it and done as much as I could. I feel in control right now (8.30 am). My goal today is to stay in control like yesterday from 8am to 4pm. I valued my time and stayed alert. But at 4pm I lost it.
