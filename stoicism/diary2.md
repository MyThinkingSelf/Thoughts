### Epictetus bath.
The passage where epitectus wrote about the decision to go to public baths despite its possibile inherent trouble resonated with me. I call this technique "goal adjunction". Your second goal is to keep a stoic mindset. I went to 2 places today, and thought a lot about the goal and the stoic goal. This worked. More specifically I managed to keep my ego in check in places where I tends to let him taking control.

### thinking place
One place I went was a public space of philosophical discussions. I did not intended to talk because I wanted to avoid ego stuff. But, strangely enough, it was about a subject very important for stoicism. So I talked a little bit on this subject. Each time I talked, I mentionned that I was not a specialist and many people here should now more. Maybe it's wrong and nobody knew stuff about stoicism. But, anyway, taking a naive position was very confortable. Another thing is that I took much time to listen to what people say and to ponder it before answering. I was more calm than usual. Not overly excited in the face to face relationship.

### stoicism today
One thing that struck me was how non-stoic was the approach of people on this subject. None of the guys involved brought up stoic ideas about losing things. Paradoxally, this may be the reason why stoicism get more adepts. When ones discover about stoicism, this is a mindshift in this modern way of thinking life. Maybe.

### early results, not completely confident though, getting ready to loose stoicism
On the contrary of the first days. I start to see results. I am more aware of the time I am consumming. I kept my ego in check at some times. My seven mental images I built gave me confidence. It's difficult to say if rehearsing these images have an effect, but building them, personalizing them was a pleasant step. It feels like I am making mine the precepts I find important. However, what if tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, or even the incoming week I loose this sense of control ? Will I get this idea in the back of my head : "maybe I overrated stoicim", "I am stupid to think that it's enough to face life". In a word : decept. I do not count the cases in my life where I lost some habits or mindset I was building. Will it different this time ? I can't be sure. I could tell me a story of why this time it will be different. But it would ease my situation right now, and give me risk for the future. If I loose against myself, I would loose this sort of faith I am building. This may be more thougtful to accept that there will be a time when things won't go well. I must be ready to loose stoicism ideas themselves in order to behave according the reason if I encounter deception in my progress. This is a nice paradox, if i put my bound to stoicism in things that I can loose, I may improve the chances to keep (at least a part) of this mindset on the future.

### loosing stoicism, Honesty and diffusion of a message
Public figures on stoicism don't have the same amount of freedom as we, novice, have. They engaged many things in their filiation. They can't play the "naive position" about stoicism. We, novice, wait for them to be highly knowledgable about stoicism. They cannot really share their doubts about stoicism (maybe even to themselves). We do not expect from them to thinking aloud but to share what is the more convincing in stoicism. Their mission is not to share their most inner thoughts on the subject but helping more people by getting them him. They won't change radically for example leaving stoicism for another conception of existence because so much is in play. Maybe I am overdramatising the thing. I know this is one of the reason I am not confortable with our publishing culture in academia. I like honesty, I want to be able to share and discuss my most important doubts or sensible things about my work and the work of others. But this is not the game of academia. This can be done only in private circles. Or is it ? The path of public honesty must be very miserable, but this is something a stoic can stand if well trained. As his goal is his goal, not the side-bonuses of public appearance (wealth, fame). But on a practical point of view, the impact of such honest approaches has the risk to very low. I don't know. This everything to say that I see mental burdens in delivering thoughts. Honesty Versus Impact.

### unclear vizualisations (2) reference to a post for 11/10/2015
I am reading and editing my past writings. This is interesting. One edit became too large and took this current place. The mp3 was not dealing with negative vizualisation. But Epictetus helped a bit. Instead of mental projection, I tried simply to keep it mind that one day I might be without her. Vizualizing it...today I think it's too strong for me and just simple thoughts (instead of dire mental projections) seems to do a better job. One argument for more simple mental exercices is that if I have to vizualize everything I might lose is time consumming. Instead, burying into my mind that I do not possess anything but my stoic state of mind, that it's ok to get and lose something can be a better objective. At least these are my thoughts at the moment. What about this idea of "appreciating each moment with X as it was the last", I am starting to be doubtful. I doubt that it's an interesting goal to reach (too much rooter into a culture of intense feelings, positive or negative, wheras stoic propose a culture of tranquility) and that human psychology can hardly be bent towards this limit.

### Nietzsche and Nature
I dig a bit into Nietzsche critic of stoicism. I still like it. I think many thoughts of Nietzsche are conflicting with stoicism. Some, however, are directly inflicted to this school of thought. The passage in Beyong good/bad is very often cited. Indeed it's pretty aggressive. As it deals with this multi-facet idea (and maybe debated, I don't know) of living in accordance with the nature, the rebutal is easily found. But, I kind of adhere to a part of the Nietzsche critic. I read from Irvine that some stoics believed (or made people believe) that it could be proven that stoicism was the only path to a good life. I think this is targeted by Nietzsche. *Stoics put their dogma of the existence in what they call Nature, not deducing the former by the later*. This is a common mistake to avoid admitting that our conception of the world is not influenced (if not built upon) the conception of our own existence, or of our own body. Stoics created the idea of Nature the same way sects (succesful or not) build an idea of God sacralizing a whole package of rules and precepts. Once again, this deals with only part of the possible ideas of what is meant by Nature (and nature) in the context. I currently don't believe that Nature can dictate an objective way of life, nor our reasonning ability. Many approaches can be taken. Among them, the elevation against certain conception of the Nature, for example, the revolt against absurdity of existence. Nietzsche did not believe much in rules (and spit on sacralized ones). So do I. Maybe this idea would allow a stoic student to be more flexible in the construction of his own philosophy of life. Nature is dead. If I truly think that stoicism follows an unbreakable logic, then I am enslaved to it.
I wrote this passage without many nuances. This is maybe a Nietzchean trait, the guy was maybe more nuanced in his mind than in his writings. My thoughts are here exagerated, but there are some ideas that must be written without moderation to be light and well-formed. If I am totally wrong, I would fall from higher, I will possibly regret these strong words one day, who knows.

### A stoic paradox ?
In investigating the idea of a Nieztschean stoicism, I stumbled upon this idea. Avoidance and building independance are two differents strategies to avoid being enslaved to things which are not goods. I guess avoiding a situation can be a strategy when our mindset is not strong enough. Stoics seems to use both. For example they avoid the company of non-philosophers or vile people. The reason is that wrong values can be contagious. If they built a strong mindset, it would be possible to enjoy compagny of these people. Also, but here I am less sure, one impression is that they don't like risk-taking. But as a Stoic is able to support the bad things related to risk (like money loss), they should be more risk taker than normal people. In other words, it's like to beef up and avoid fights in the same time. It's sad to beef up if we do not fight and sad to avoid fight if we are able to handle three men at once.

### Philosphy of life as a tool to formalize our relation with ourselves, others and the rest of the world
Stoics have pretty much the same answer for this three area. Acceptation is the master word ?

### Stoicism love. 
I read the chapter 5 of Robertson book. I don't understand many things :
- Why is it stoic to love everyone ?
- How a stoic can love (especially non-stoic people) ?
At the present time, I am not convinced. I tend to prefer building strong friendship than to feel a bound with the whole world. I feel more Nietzchean than stoic on this subject. Caring about everyone seems too heavy. Maybe in a sense of esthetic. Finding everyone appreciable seems wise to me. But caring about people as myself, this sounds crazy. I am glad to capture this thought as there are good chances that my mind changes on the relation between this kind of christian love and stoicism.

### Nietzsche, Stoicism and Michael Ure. First contact.
The relation that Nietzsche have with stoicism seems complex. I am reading a paper of Michael Ure. "Nietzsche's Free Spirit Trilogy and Stoic Therapy". I like the writing style which goes straigth to the point. Power is conceived as the central theme that animates Nietzsche therapy and its relation with others. One passage amongst others that stroke me : 
>According to Nietzsche, all these interpretations are therapies that address the affective states the human animal experiences when it discovers that the external world is beyond its control. For Nietzsche emotions derive from and register our evaluation of our power to shape or control the external world; the negative affects (fear) register a perceived lack of power. He assumes that once the human animal recognizes that the external world is not within the scope of its control, it seeks or invents means by which it can reclaim a feeling of power. Nietzsche first introduces his (in)famous notion of power, then, not as a meta-physical belief, or as a normative principle, but as a psychological hypothesis for explaining the origins and development of those cultural forms human beings have created in order to endure vulnerability. 

I see the author has written a book and contributed to another on this subject. This has good chance to be on my reading list. 

### elogious portrait of epictetus...by Nietzsche.
Michael Ure reports the distinction between human and cosmic stoicism brought up by John Sellars. Interesting distinction btw. He writes that "human stoicism" fits exactly the portrait of Epictetus written by Nietzche. Strangely enough, The Dawn is not on wikisource. But some sources are available elsewhere (scans and text recognition) like here  https://archive.org/stream/cu31924021569177/cu31924021569177_djvu.txt The passage is 546, but OCR worked badly and turned the 5 in S so ctrl+F "S46" to get it. The portrait is ellogious. He depicts that Epictetus is free from god and believes in reason only which distinguishes radically from christianism. He his not an idealistic and has already found solid joy :
> Epictetus, on the other hand, neither hopes nor allows his best treasure to be given him — he possesses it already, holds it bravely in his hand, and defies the world to take it away from him

### Dawn Nietzsche
I never read Dawn. More specifically, I think it is with birth of tragedy the sole book I did not read from him. Good for me as it's the right time for me to read it. According to Michael Ure, it's written under the direct influence of epictetus. Indeed, the few passages refered by Michael Ure are an interesting mix between the Nietzsche I know and Stoicism. This is then an interesting read that awaits me. I shall continue to read Ure to see how and why the departure from stoicism has been made by Nietzsche. 

### Nietzsche failed to find an alternative to Stoicism
This is the claim of Michael Ure. After The Dawn Nietzsche wants to develop an alternative where passions and pain is valuable. According Ure, he failed to do so. By taking the stance of the amor fati and the eternal recurence of the same which is close to stoic concepts, he simply left his "human stoicism" for a "cosmic stoicism. This cosmic aspect, according Ure, do no allow more space for passion and pain. I am not sure to get exactly the argument why it is, but the main argument seems to be that Nietzsche did not provide any convincing one. Eternal return of the same leads to stoic apathea. I found this paper very convincing but it would be valuable to confront this hypothesis. 

### live in agreement with nature (fun)
As I understood, this idea has various aspects. But concerning emotionnal aspect everytime I read it I have a mental image at the back of my had. A small river in a green space. Am I alone ? While it does not really cover the complexity thoughts behind this expression, it has an emotionnal aspect sounding like "This rivers flow, Stay calm dude".

### Becker and "following nature"
Today Massimo posted an interesting highlight on Becker book. This is one amongst others. Becker reduce the "live in agreement with nature" with something close to "understanding and accept how nature works". The argument for this modern form is that ancient stoics did not have a better science than a teleological conception of nature. It sounds right to me, and if I am not wrong it was a popular conception at the time. But, in the same time, a teleogical conception go very well with a philosophy of acceptation. Maybe I am influenced (I could drop the maybe here) by my recent read, but the passage from human stoicism to cosmic stoicism makes sense. If one wants to accept past events and future, the best metaphysical support is one where things could not have been otherwise (and why not with a bonus : that there was a reason behind it).

### metaphysics and stoicism
A discussion on reddit allowed me to be more clear with myself concerning my position about the "Nature". I posted something close from the last paragraphe "Becker and "following nature" and someone interrogated me with the problem of believing something just for the sake of relief. https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/3pssps/massimo_explains_how_a_new_stoicism_conceives/. My last comment revealed my Nietzschean affiliation I think. I should copy it in this diary to keep track of it.
> This is a worry I share. My real current belief is that the world is absurd. I don't think we can do much with this conception of the world. What follows is one way to think about that, from my most relativist self : The whole enterprise to find a way to live deduced by our place in the cosmos is to me a failed enterprise. What many people do, wether they admit to do it or not, is that they think the world to fit their state of mind, when it's not to manipulate other minds. I tend to prefer manipulate myself consciously than inconsciously. Metaphysics are just stories we build for ourselves, purely human abstractions as well as the concept of Truth. We are not the slave of these representations, but their masters. They should be designed in the same way we design a home.

This is clearly a half-comfortable proposition. But in the same time, it is in agreement with both my relativism and my appreciation of the stoic world representation concerning its practical benefits.

## negative vizualisation, a suggestion to make it easier. 
I am reading the 7th chapter of Donaldson book. This is interesting as he goes in great practical details for this activity, which I found lacking in Irvine book. He is uncomfortable with the term coined by Irvine "negative vizualisation", because an external event should, in Stoic perspective, be indifferent. To be fair, negative makes sense as it's just the opposite of the positive vizualisation mental activity. But, it's also true that words have strength. I think negative viz are complex to me because one should in the same time picture the event and picture a stoic state of mind. The cognitive load associated with it is high. I suggest that the stoic state of mind can be pictured indepently of external events. I mean, just with an abstract idea of a misfortune (not the misfortune itself, depicted in details) focusig on stoic precepts : 
- amor fati 
- this can't be changed
- This is not the event I suffer from but my judgement of the event.
- the only thing in my control is my state of mind
- I knew this could hapen and I prepared myself
- This is nothing in a cosmic perspective
- "Never say about anything, I have lost it, but say I have restored it"
- This gives me an occasion to train my stoic abilities)
- Analysis and decomposition of the even in smaller part
- indifferent
I believe that these precepts can be encapsulated and enhanced by mental imaging. Once this is mastered (which I do not for the moment), I think negative vizualisation can be done more easily, overiding this basic reflex I have which consist to find solutions to the state I picture in my mind, or solutions to avoid this state (and that not what negative viz are made for).
