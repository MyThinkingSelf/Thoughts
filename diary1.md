Stoicism journal

### current readings
Finished to read the book of Irvine, and discovered I read it during the stoic week (funny isnt it ?). I appreciated it a lot, from many facets (practical, personnal, non scholar, still a bit scholar to patch things up at the end). I don't see how it could have been better. But despite the 40 first letters of Seneca (to Lucilius) I don't know much else about stoicism. 
 
### angry for that ?
I discovered I was too often angry (even during a very brief moment) against participants in philosophical podcasts I listened. I routinely comment out loud. I have various hypothesis on why that should be investigated futher. In the meantime, I decided to stop listening for today.

### Massimo
I found out that Massimo from rationnaly speaking (a podcast I like a lot, but I miss Massimo departure even if Julia is doing a really good job) went very active on stoicism. I guess, by talking about the subject in the pdcast, he played a role in my recent interest to stoicism, as well as my (lets say 1-third) mini life crisis. He seems well aware on recent authors and blog on the subject.

### read or not read ?   
At this point I am wondering if reading too much about stoicism is not a slippery slope of the scholar I am. I have been in contact in already much material with the book of Irvine. As a good stoic should better start practicing than read. I feel that I would like to be an expert of the subject. Maybe to feel the goodness of being an expert. Here is then my first exercice. An analytical sight on this makes me think that there are maybe bad values behind this goal like fame or social status. My time is limited so I should focus on the essential. Reading interesting stuff can give me some pleasure. I guess I should look more into stoic litterature later, for the joy of learning and to bring some new lights on my stoic path. 

### unclear vizualisations
I tried a bit negative visualisation. It's way too early to draw some conclusions. It's still unclear what I should visualise. For example, what about visualising loosing my significant other. This is a big one. What should I consider ? My life without her ? The day I lose her ? My grief ? All of them ? Maybe all of them. Or maybe not the grief, as it's not the mental state that counts but the situation itself to avoid part of the violence of this possible future mental state. It seems that the goal to prepare myself to such events and the appreciation of current thing (my s.o) appeals to different visualisations. Or it is ? It seems that I should avoid to plan stuff. It seems like I go down the path of "what-if scenario" and find a way to solve my problems by thinking ahead. This what it's often understood when talking about preparing to an event (like travel) but it's not really this kind of preparation targeted. Or is it at least a bit ? If there is no plan if a terrible event appears, I guess it's a problem. I am not sure whether it's the way to go. Maybe some reading on negative viz. would be helpful to better seize what to visualize to achieve which goals. From the blog of Massimo (https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com) I got this links http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/stoicismtoday/2013/11/24/audio-recordings-for-stoic-week-2014/ I will put them on my mp3 player and see if it helps.

### jealousy
One of the podcaster published 4 books and is around 30 years old. I feel a small feeling of jaleousy. This must be investigated further. One way is to understand why I feel jealous whereas I don't even know if she is happy in her condition of writer. Any stoic would say me among other things to focus on the representation of my own life. Jealousy won't give me more strength or more hapiness. If one day it's time to write books, then I shall write books. But is it my goal now ? Not at all. Keep it quiet jealousy and listen what the girl says. 

### confort
Interestingly I keep an eye on my physical confort. Like how and where I sit. This is stupid but I might have underestimated this aspect in my life. Not sure it's a stoic goal to seek confort. Nevertheless I feel ok with considering this.

### order
I feel I want to make order in my life. Physically I have an unusal will to fix some problems and order files on my physical and computer desk. I have not done much but felt a subtle difference. This can be the result of other factors than previous readings like return from holidays.

### uncalmness and learning
I feel happy that I know about many things : go&chess, academic research, my two researchs fields, statistics, programmation, learning methods, a tiny bit of philosophy, mindmapping. Sometimes I feel drown by the implications of this diversity, each subject call me for actions that I would like to take. But I can't take them all. From a stoic point of view, did my freedom and my calm increases or have been diminished. My calm has not been improved by this plurality. Or should have been ? Indeed my freedom "objective" has improved (I can do more things), but my "stoic fredom" is serverly damaged as I can sometimes feel enslaved to these subject of interest. I feel terrified at the idea of turning the back of some of them. But something not far from it will happen. This plurality has many implications. It might inflate my ego, provoke extasy. Sometimes it provoqued dark moods : all of that to achieve what ? Does learning in a stoic perspective should be minimal ? Or can it be more exhaustive ? In this case how to not feel enslaved by these learning materials. Learning and doing can be separated ? Can I learn only for the pleasure, with no idea of applying this new knowledge ? If yes, what is the point of learning ? I see then two possibilities to find stoic calm on this subject. Learn less or learn to bound learning into a controlled state. This problem is very close frome one of another major one, my two many projects problem. Too much learning might be a cause. This need serious prolongated investigations.

### Honesty
It seems that I am more inclined to be honest with the motives I give to people to explain why I can do what I am supposed to do or why I did not these tasks. My last mail might have been more honest than with my routine state of mind. Just an impression. Maybe it's this journal which makes me practice honesty.

### Negative visualisation about hard past event
This morning, I thought on one of my most penible emotionnal experience and rethink how I would have respond from a Sq perspective. This was kind of smooth. No idea if this visualization has an effect but I kind of felt good after it. Like I repaired the past. Imagination and souvenirs, I don't feel that they differ greatly from a cognitive perspective. What if I replace this hard time with a nice come-back and not the emotional whole I dig up at that time. Should it have effect to better deal with novel situations ? Or should it have effect to chase away the pain of this moment ?

### Night visualisations
I listened this morning and yesterday evening the mp3 files. Interesting to say the least that the root of some meditation exercices come from pythagoras. Also interesting that he used mental review also to better enhance memory. Here is then the guy who first wrote about mental review and free recall (one of my favourite learning techniques). Returning to stoic. I failed to review my day completely. Lack of time, consumed partly by listening the mp3. Got sleepy to early. I should try later. Quite the same for the morning exercice. I will have better occasions.
