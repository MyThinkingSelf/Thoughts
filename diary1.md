Stoicism journal

### current readings
Finished to read the book of Irvine, and discovered I read it during the stoic week (funny isnt it ?). I appreciated it a lot, from many facets (practical, personnal, non scholar, still a bit scholar to patch things up at the end). I don't see how it could have been better. But despite the 40 first letters of Seneca (to Lucilius) I don't know much else about stoicism. 
 
### angry for that ?
I discovered I was too often angry (even during a very brief moment) against participants in philosophical podcasts I listened. I routinely comment out loud. I have various hypothesis on why that should be investigated futher. In the meantime, I decided to stop listening for today.

### Massimo
I found out that Massimo from rationnaly speaking (a podcast I like a lot, but I miss Massimo departure even if Julia is doing a really good job) went very active on stoicism. I guess, by talking about the subject in the pdcast, he played a role in my recent interest to stoicism, as well as my (lets say 1-third) mini life crisis. He seems well aware on recent authors and blog on the subject.

### read or not read ?   
At this point I am wondering if reading too much about stoicism is not a slippery slope of the scholar I am. I have been in contact in already much material with the book of Irvine. As a good stoic should better start practicing than read. I feel that I would like to be an expert of the subject. Maybe to feel the goodness of being an expert. Here is then my first exercice. An analytical sight on this makes me think that there are maybe bad values behind this goal like fame or social status. My time is limited so I should focus on the essential. Reading interesting stuff can give me some pleasure. I guess I should look more into stoic litterature later, for the joy of learning and to bring some new lights on my stoic path. 

### unclear vizualisations
I tried a bit negative visualisation. It's way too early to draw some conclusions. It's still unclear what I should visualise. For example, what about visualising loosing my significant other. This is a big one. What should I consider ? My life without her ? The day I lose her ? My grief ? All of them ? Maybe all of them. Or maybe not the grief, as it's not the mental state that counts but the situation itself to avoid part of the violence of this possible future mental state. It seems that the goal to prepare myself to such events and the appreciation of current thing (my s.o) appeals to different visualisations. Or it is ? It seems that I should avoid to plan stuff. It seems like I go down the path of "what-if scenario" and find a way to solve my problems by thinking ahead. This what it's often understood when talking about preparing to an event (like travel) but it's not really this kind of preparation targeted. Or is it at least a bit ? If there is no plan if a terrible event appears, I guess it's a problem. I am not sure whether it's the way to go. Maybe some reading on negative viz. would be helpful to better seize what to visualize to achieve which goals. From the blog of Massimo (https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com) I got this links http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/stoicismtoday/2013/11/24/audio-recordings-for-stoic-week-2014/ I will put them on my mp3 player and see if it helps.

### jealousy
One of the podcaster published 4 books and is around 30 years old. I feel a small feeling of jaleousy. This must be investigated further. One way is to understand why I feel jealous whereas I don't even know if she is happy in her condition of writer. Any stoic would say me among other things to focus on the representation of my own life. Jealousy won't give me more strength or more hapiness. If one day it's time to write books, then I shall write books. But is it my goal now ? Not at all. Keep it quiet jealousy and listen what the girl says. 

### confort
Interestingly I keep an eye on my physical confort. Like how and where I sit. This is stupid but I might have underestimated this aspect in my life. Not sure it's a stoic goal to seek confort. Nevertheless I feel ok with considering this.

### order
I feel I want to make order in my life. Physically I have an unusal will to fix some problems and order files on my physical and computer desk. I have not done much but felt a subtle difference. This can be the result of other factors than previous readings like return from holidays.
